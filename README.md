# vimrc
-------

This is where I keep my configuration files. To use, simply copy the .vimrc file to your home directory. The following commands should suffice:

```
git clone git://github.com/calebsmith/vimrc
cp .gitconfig ~
cp .vimrc ~
cp -R colors ~/.vim/
cp -R syntax ~/.vim/
```

Upon running vim the first time, vundle will be installed, which will install
the vim bundles in turn.

N.B. The colors and syntax files present have their own authors and licences
present at the top of their files. These are included for convenience.
