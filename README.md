# vimrc
-------

This is where I keep my configuration files. To use clone the repo and use
make. To copy all dotfiles to the home directory use the following commands:

```
git clone git://github.com/calebsmith/vimrc
make all
```

Use `make vim`, `make git`, or `make tmux` to copy configuration for those
programs only.

Upon running vim the first time, vundle will be installed, which will install
the vim bundles defined in .vimrc in turn.
