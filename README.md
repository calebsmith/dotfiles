# vimrc
-------

This is where I keep my configuration files. To use, simply copy the .vimrc file to your home directory. The following commands should suffice:

```
git clone git://github.com/calebsmith/vimrc
cp .gitconfig ~
cp .vimrc ~
```

Upon running vim the first time, vundle will be installed, which will install
the vim bundles in turn.
